This repository is dedicated to the code for a landing page created for Remine India, a recognized startup focusing on recycling e-waste and Li batteries. The landing page has a modern, professional and responsive design, and it was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an interactive user experience.

The landing page consists of several sections, including a header with a navigation bar, a hero section with a call-to-action button, a services section that emphasizes the key offerings of the startup, a team section with short bios and photos of team members, and a footer that provides contact information and social media links.

All of the code is organized into separate files and folders, with index.html handling HTML markup, style.css for CSS styling, script.js for JavaScript functionality, and an assets folder containing images and other media files.

The landing page is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, and it provides a concise yet informative overview of Remine India's services, values, and team. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a useful resource for those interested in learning more about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web development.
